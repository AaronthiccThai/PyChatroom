# PyChatroom

## What is it?
PyChatroom is a simple implementation of a chatroom using websockets and databases.
It is the culmination of the skills I've learnt from networking (COMP3311) and databases (COMP3331).
Inside the main folder contains this implementation of the chatroom. This project is still ongoing as when I've learnt HTML/CSS, I aim to add more to the frontend of the chatroom.

## How to run
Start by establishing a database by running the database script. Then we can just start our server, and then our client.

## Others
The tcpsocket folder contains an implementation of a chatroom via python's low level socket module using TCP
and the udpsocket folder contains an implementation of a chatroom via python's low level socket module using UDP.
