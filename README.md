# PyChatroom

## What is it?
PyChatroom is a simple implementation of a chatroom using websockets and databases.
It is the culmination of the skills I've learnt from networking (COMP3311) and databases (COMP3331).
Inside the main folder contains this implementation of the chatroom which is comprised of a sql script, a html document with a very very simple frontend, and a simple server.
## Others
The tcpsocket folder contains an implementation of a chatroom via python's low level socket module using TCP
and the udpsocket folder contains an implementation of a chatroom via python's low level socket module using UDP.
